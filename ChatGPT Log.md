# ISTA 2023: ChatGPT: My Log #

This whole transcript is [accessible directly at ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/0c7f81e2-120b-4008-945b-ac1c994cf6da). Below are all prompts and answers, on which I based the presentation contents.

## Prompt 1 ##

Dear ChatGPT, I want to create a web app, which will be separated in two Docker containers: one serving my frontend, and one serving my backend services. The backend services container will have a simple service that it built with Flutter and uses lightweight relational database from the same container. The frontend service container will serve a Flutter frontend application.

Let's start with you providing me with the instructions, needed to build the backend container.

Certainly! Let's break down the process for creating a Docker container for your backend services.

## Answer 1 ##

### Backend Service Docker Container ###

1. **Set Up the Environment**

    Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, follow the installation process from Docker's official documentation.

2. **Choose a Base Image**

    Since you're building a Flutter service, which most likely implies you're using Dart for the backend, you'll need a base image that supports Dart.

    Create a `Dockerfile` in your backend project directory.

3. **Dockerfile for Backend**

    Here's a basic example of what your `Dockerfile` might look like:

    ```Dockerfile
    # Use the official Dart image as a parent image
    FROM google/dart:latest

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the local package files to the container's workspace
    ADD pubspec.yaml /app/pubspec.yaml
    RUN pub get --offline

    ADD . /app
    RUN pub get --offline

    # Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Run the application
    CMD ["dart", "bin/main.dart"]
    ```

    > This example assumes your entry point for the backend is `bin/main.dart`. Adjust as needed.

4. **Setting Up the Database**

    If you're using a lightweight relational database that should run within the same container (though this might not be the best architecture choice for larger applications), add the necessary steps to your `Dockerfile`.

    As an example, let's say you're using SQLite:

    1. Ensure you have the necessary SQLite Dart package in your `pubspec.yaml`.
    2. Install SQLite on your Docker image by adding the installation commands to your `Dockerfile`.

5. **Build the Docker Image**

    Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run:

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-backend-image-name .
    ```

6. **Run the Docker Container**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 your-backend-image-name
    ```

    This binds port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host.

**Notes**:

- When it comes to production, you might want to use more optimized Docker images, ensure proper database management, and potentially decouple your database into a separate container or managed service.
- If your backend service needs to talk to other services, consider using Docker Compose. This will allow you to define multi-container applications, making it easier to manage connections between services.
- Make sure your application respects the Twelve-Factor App principles when deploying to Docker containers. This ensures smooth scaling and operation in cloud environments.
- Remember, security is crucial. Always follow best practices for securing your containers, applications, and databases.

Once you have your backend container set up and working, you can then proceed with your frontend container in a similar manner.

## Prompt 2 ##

Please give me more detailed instructions about how to include SQLite in my Dockerfile.

## Answer 2 ##

Absolutely! Integrating SQLite into your Docker container requires a few additional steps. Let's build upon the earlier Dockerfile for your Dart backend.

### Integrating SQLite with Docker ###

1. **Add SQLite to your Dart Project**

   In your `pubspec.yaml`, add the necessary SQLite package for Dart:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     sqflite: latest_version
   ```

   This `sqflite` package usually works with Flutter mobile apps by default, but if you're using Dart on the backend, you'll essentially just be interfacing with the SQLite database directly without `sqflite`. In that case, you may need a different package or method to interface with SQLite, such as `dart-sqlite`.

2. **Modify the Dockerfile to Install SQLite**

   Update your Dockerfile to install SQLite:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official Dart image as a parent image
   FROM google/dart:latest

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Install SQLite3
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

   # Copy the local package files to the container's workspace
   ADD pubspec.yaml /app/pubspec.yaml
   RUN pub get --offline

   ADD . /app
   RUN pub get --offline

   # Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Run the application
   CMD ["dart", "bin/main.dart"]
   ```

   The key addition here is the `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev` command, which installs SQLite and its development files. The development files (`libsqlite3-dev`) may be necessary if any Dart packages require them to interface with SQLite.

3. **Build and Run the Docker Image**

   As before, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-backend-image-name .
   ```

   Then run:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 your-backend-image-name
   ```

4. **Database File Management**

   Note that when you run SQLite in a Docker container, the database will be stored within the container's filesystem. This means that if the container is deleted, you'll lose the database unless you've mounted it to persistent storage.

   If you want to persist data outside of the container, you should consider volume mounting:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/on/host:/app/db your-backend-image-name
   ```

   This would store the SQLite database file in `/path/on/host` on your host machine and `/app/db` in your Docker container.

   Adjust your backend's database path configuration to match the mounted directory.

**Note**: While SQLite is an excellent lightweight database, it's not typically used in production for web-based backends due to concurrency and scaling issues. If you plan to move to production with a larger user base, consider using a more robust database system.

## Prompt 3 ##

Trying to build the Dockerfile gave me errors because of missing pubscpec.yaml.

Give me the initial commands for building the backend app in Dart.

## Answer 3 ##

Of course! I apologize for the oversight. Let's start by setting up a simple Dart backend application. This guide will take you through initializing a Dart project and adding necessary dependencies for a web server. 

### Setting Up a Dart Backend Application ###

1. **Install Dart SDK**

   If you haven't already installed the Dart SDK, do so by following the instructions at the official Dart website: [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

2. **Create a new Dart Project**

   Use the Dart tool to create a new project:

   ```bash
   dart create my_backend_app
   ```

   Navigate to the new project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my_backend_app
   ```

3. **Add Web Server Dependencies**

   To build a web server with Dart, you can use the `shelf` package. Open the `pubspec.yaml` in your project directory and add the following dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     shelf: ^1.2.0
   ```

   Then, run:

   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

   This will fetch the required packages for your project.

4. **Write a Simple Backend Web Server**

   Create a new Dart file for your web server. You can name it `server.dart` inside the `bin` directory:

   ```dart
   import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart' as shelf;
   import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;

   void main() {
     var handler = const shelf.Pipeline().addMiddleware(shelf.logRequests())
         .addHandler(_echoRequest);

     io.serve(handler, 'localhost', 8080).then((server) {
       print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
     });
   }

   shelf.Response _echoRequest(shelf.Request request) {
     return shelf.Response.ok('Hello, Dart Backend!');
   }
   ```

   This sets up a basic server that responds with "Hello, Dart Backend!" for every request.

5. **Run Your Backend**

   To run the server:

   ```bash
   dart run bin/server.dart
   ```

   You should be able to visit `http://localhost:8080` in a browser and see the message "Hello, Dart Backend!".

Now that you have a basic Dart backend application set up, you can Dockerize it following the instructions provided in the previous answers. Ensure that the Dockerfile is in the root of your Dart project (same directory as `pubspec.yaml`) to avoid the missing `pubspec.yaml` error.

## Prompt 4 ##

I'm getting these errors when building my container:

```txt
#9 1.331 Resolving dependencies...
#9 1.695 The current Dart SDK version is 2.15.1.
#9 1.696 
#9 1.696 Because my_backend_app requires SDK version ^3.0.6, version solving failed.
```

What's wrong?

## Answer 4 ##

The error message indicates there's a mismatch between the Dart SDK versions:

- Your Docker container is using Dart SDK version `2.15.1`.
- Your `my_backend_app` is requiring a Dart SDK version `^3.0.6` as specified in the `pubspec.yaml`.

To resolve this, you have a couple of options:

### 1. Update the Dart SDK in the Dockerfile ###

The simplest solution, if available, would be to use a newer Dart image that comes with the required SDK version. You can check the available tags on the Docker Hub for the Dart image to find a suitable version.

Replace:

```Dockerfile
FROM google/dart:latest
```

With a version-specific tag that has the SDK version you need:

```Dockerfile
FROM google/dart:<desired_version>
```

However, as of my last training data (January 2022), Dart SDK v3.x was not released. Therefore, you might be referencing a future version or there might be an error in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

### 2. Update the SDK Version in `pubspec.yaml` ###

If the above method is not feasible because such a Dart version does not exist yet (or is not available as a Docker image), you might want to update your `pubspec.yaml` to match the Dart SDK version in the Docker container.

Open `pubspec.yaml`, and adjust the SDK version constraint:

```yaml
environment:
  sdk: '>=2.15.1 <3.0.0'
```

This would allow your app to work with any SDK version from `2.15.1` up to (but not including) `3.0.0`.

After making the changes, you can try building the Docker image again.

**Note**: If you adjust the SDK version in `pubspec.yaml`, ensure all your dependencies are compatible with that version. You might also want to verify why the project was requesting a Dart version that seems to be unavailable or yet-to-be-released. If the version was indeed a mistake, correcting it should resolve the problem.

## Prompt 5 ##

I get an error:

```txt
RUN pub get --offline
```

## Answer 5 ##

Sorry for the confusion earlier. Using `--offline` with `pub get` in a Docker container isn't suitable because the container doesn't have any packages cached yet. It requires internet access to fetch the packages for the first time.

Let's correct that.

Remove the `--offline` flag from the `pub get` commands in your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
...
ADD pubspec.yaml /app/pubspec.yaml
RUN pub get

ADD . /app
RUN pub get
...
```

This should resolve the error. When you run `docker build`, ensure that the Docker daemon has access to the internet so it can fetch the Dart packages.

Remember, using `pub get` without `--offline` will fetch packages from the internet. If you have any private or local packages, you'll need a more complex setup to make them available within the Docker build context.

## Prompt 6 ##

I still get the error:

```txt
 > [5/7] RUN pub get:
#9 0.201 /bin/sh: 1: pub: not found
```

## Answer 6 ##

I apologize for the oversight. This error means that the Docker container does not recognize the `pub` command directly because it's not in the system's PATH.

When using the Dart Docker image, the `pub` tool is not globally available as a command like `dart`. Instead, you should use it as `dart pub`.

Here's the correction for the Dockerfile:

Replace:

```Dockerfile
RUN pub get
```

With:

```Dockerfile
RUN dart pub get
```

So, your Dockerfile commands related to package retrieval should look like:

```Dockerfile
...
ADD pubspec.yaml /app/pubspec.yaml
RUN dart pub get

ADD . /app
RUN dart pub get
...
```

Try building the Docker container again after making these adjustments.

## Prompt 7 ##

it says:

```txt
docker run -p 8080:8080 your-backend-image-name

Serving at http://localhost:8080"
```

But I cannot open anything at <http://localhost:8080>

## Answer 7 ##

If your Docker container indicates that it's serving on `http://localhost:8080` but you can't access the service from your host machine's browser, several factors could be responsible.

Let's troubleshoot:

1. **Docker Network Mode**:

   By default, if you are on Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac, containers run in a virtual machine, and `localhost` in the container does not mean the host machine's localhost. The port forwarding with `-p` should handle this, but sometimes issues can arise.

2. **App Listening Address**:

   If your Dart backend inside the Docker container is listening on `localhost`, it will only accept connections from within the container. To accept connections from outside the container, your application should listen on all network interfaces, often represented by the address `0.0.0.0`.

   Modify the Dart code where you call `io.serve()`:

   From:

   ```dart
   io.serve(handler, 'localhost', 8080);
   ```

   To:

   ```dart
   io.serve(handler, '0.0.0.0', 8080);
   ```

   Rebuild your Docker image and try running it again.

3. **Docker Daemon Issues**:

   Occasionally, Docker can run into issues with networking. Restarting the Docker daemon can sometimes resolve these anomalies.

4. **Firewall or Security Software**:

   Ensure that no firewall or security software on your machine is blocking the connection to port `8080`.

5. **Port Conflicts**:

   Ensure that no other service on your host machine is running on port `8080`. You can check this with:

   - On Linux/macOS: `lsof -i :8080`
   - On Windows: `netstat -an | find "8080"`

   If another service is using the port, you can either stop that service or choose another port for your Docker container.

6. **Test Inside the Container**:

   You can exec into the container to test if the server is running inside the container:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/sh
   ```

   Then, inside the container, you can use curl or wget to test:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

   If this returns your expected response, it's a clear sign the issue is related to Docker's networking between the container and your host.

7. **Container Logs**:

   Check the logs of your running container:

   ```bash
   docker logs <container_id_or_name>
   ```

   This can provide more insights if there's an issue inside the container or with the Dart server.

After verifying and applying necessary changes from the above steps, try accessing `http://localhost:8080` again. If you're still facing issues, please provide any additional error messages or logs, and I'll help you further troubleshoot the situation.

## Prompt 8 ##

Let's add `/users` backend API, which will be a testig stub for list of users, providing five example users with a fixed data.

## Answer 8 ##

Sure, let's add a `/users` endpoint to our Dart backend that returns a list of five example users.

1. **Modify your Dart Backend**

   In your `server.dart` file inside the `bin` directory, let's make some modifications:

   ```dart
   import 'dart:convert';
   import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart' as shelf;
   import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;

   void main() {
     var handler = const shelf.Pipeline().addMiddleware(shelf.logRequests())
         .addHandler(_router);

     io.serve(handler, '0.0.0.0', 8080).then((server) {
       print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
     });
   }

   shelf.Response _router(shelf.Request request) {
     switch (request.url.path) {
       case 'users':
         return _usersHandler(request);
       default:
         return shelf.Response.notFound('Not Found');
     }
   }

   shelf.Response _usersHandler(shelf.Request request) {
     final users = [
       {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice', 'email': 'alice@example.com'},
       {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob', 'email': 'bob@example.com'},
       {'id': 3, 'name': 'Charlie', 'email': 'charlie@example.com'},
       {'id': 4, 'name': 'David', 'email': 'david@example.com'},
       {'id': 5, 'name': 'Eva', 'email': 'eva@example.com'},
     ];

     return shelf.Response.ok(
       json.encode(users),
       headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'}
     );
   }
   ```

   Here, I introduced a router function, `_router`, that directs incoming requests based on their paths. The `/users` path returns a static list of five users in JSON format. Other paths will return a "Not Found" message.

2. **Rebuild and Run the Docker Image**

   Rebuild the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-backend-image-name .
   ```

   Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 your-backend-image-name
   ```

3. **Access the `/users` Endpoint**

   After running the Docker container, visit `http://localhost:8080/users` in a web browser or use a tool like `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/users
   ```

   You should receive a JSON response containing the list of five example users.

With this setup, you've created a simple stub API that provides fixed user data. As you expand the functionality of your backend, you can extend the `_router` function to handle more routes and incorporate more complex logic and data sources.

## Prompt 9 ##

Good! Now we should create the Frontend. I want the frontend to run on a different container, and connect with the backend container throughout the already exposed API.
Please, write the frontend by using Flutter and taking into account it'll produce a web application only.

## Answer 9 ##

Certainly! To achieve this, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Flutter Web Project**
2. **Write the Flutter Web Application to Fetch Users from the Backend**
3. **Dockerize the Flutter Web Application**

### 1. Set Up the Flutter Web Project ###

If you haven't already, make sure to enable web support for Flutter:

```bash
flutter channel stable
flutter upgrade
flutter config --enable-web
```

Now, create a new Flutter project:

```bash
flutter create flutter_web_frontend
cd flutter_web_frontend
```

Then, add `http` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file to allow for API calls:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.3
```

Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the dependencies.

### 2. Write the Flutter Web Application ###

Here's a basic Flutter web application to fetch and display the list of users:

```dart
// lib/main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Web Frontend',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: UserListPage(),
    );
  }
}

class UserListPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UserListPageState createState() => _UserListPageState();
}

class _UserListPageState extends State<UserListPage> {
  List<dynamic> users = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    fetchUsers();
  }

  fetchUsers() async {
    var response = await http.get(Uri.parse('http://backend:8080/users'));
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      setState(() {
        users = json.decode(response.body);
      });
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Users")),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: users.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(users[index]['name']),
            subtitle: Text(users[index]['email']),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Take note of the URL `http://backend:8080/users` in the `fetchUsers` method. When running in containers, you can use the name of the backend container (as long as they are in the same network) to communicate between containers. In this case, we've assumed the name "backend" for the backend container, but you can adjust it according to your Docker setup.

### 3. Dockerize the Flutter Web Application ###

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your `flutter_web_frontend` directory:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Flutter SDK as the builder image
FROM google/flutter:latest as builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy everything over
COPY . .

# Build the web version of the app
RUN flutter pub get
RUN flutter build web

# Use nginx for serving the built web app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build files from the build environment
COPY --from=builder /app/build/web/ /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for nginx
EXPOSE 80
```

Build and run the frontend container:

```bash
docker build -t flutter-web-frontend-image .
docker run -p 80:80 flutter-web-frontend-image
```

Now, your frontend will be available at `http://localhost`. Remember, you'll need to ensure the backend container is running and the frontend container can communicate with it using the assumed container name "backend" or whatever you've set it to.

In a real-world scenario, using Docker Compose can make managing multi-container applications significantly more straightforward. If you need a Docker Compose setup for these two containers, do let me know!

## Prompt 10 ##

I'm getting this error in my console when trying to access the backend:

```txt
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/users' from origin 'http://localhost:64817' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

How to fix it?

## Answer 10 ##

The error you're seeing is due to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, which is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control requests made to different origins.

To resolve this, you'll need to enable CORS support on your backend so that it sends the appropriate headers allowing the request from the Flutter web app.

Here's how to enable CORS for your Dart backend using the `shelf_cors` package:

1. **Add `shelf_cors` to your Backend's `pubspec.yaml`**

   Add the `shelf_cors` package to your backend project's `pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     shelf: ^1.2.0
     shelf_cors: ^1.0.1
     # ... other dependencies ...
   ```

   And then run `dart pub get`.

2. **Update the Backend to Use CORS Middleware**

   Modify your Dart backend code to include CORS headers:

   ```dart
   import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart' as shelf;
   import 'package:shelf/shelf_io.dart' as io;
   import 'package:shelf_cors/shelf_cors.dart' as shelf_cors;

   // ... rest of your code ...

   void main() {
     var handler = const shelf.Pipeline()
         .addMiddleware(shelf.logRequests())
         .addMiddleware(shelf_cors.createCorsHeadersMiddleware(
           headers: {
             'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
             // You can add more headers if needed
           },
         ))
         .addHandler(_router);

     io.serve(handler, '0.0.0.0', 8080).then((server) {
       print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
     });
   }

   // ... rest of your code ...
   ```

3. **Rebuild and Restart Your Backend Container**

   After making the above changes, rebuild your backend Docker image and run it. The backend should now accept requests from the frontend even if they're on different ports or domains due to the CORS headers.

Do note that the configuration I provided (`'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'`) allows any origin to access the resources. In a production environment, you'd want to be more restrictive and specify only the trusted domains.

## Prompt 11 ##

I'm getting this error when updating dependencies:

```txt
Because my_backend_app depends on shelf_cors ^1.0.1 which doesn't match any
  versions, version solving failed.
```

## Answer 11 ###

It seems like the version of `shelf_cors` I specified doesn't exist or there's an issue fetching it. My apologies for the oversight.

Let's take a different approach:

1. **Check the Available Versions**

   First, check for the latest available versions of the `shelf_cors` package on the [pub.dev website](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf_cors).

2. **Update `pubspec.yaml`**

   Once you've identified the correct version, update your `pubspec.yaml` file with that version. For example:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     shelf: ^1.2.0
     shelf_cors: ^X.X.X  # replace X.X.X with the correct version you found
   ```

3. **Run `dart pub get` Again**

   After updating the `pubspec.yaml`, run `dart pub get` again to fetch the new dependencies.

4. **Proceed with the Previous Instructions**

   Continue with the instructions I provided in the previous message to implement the CORS headers in your backend server using `shelf_cors`.

If you still face any difficulties or encounter further issues, please let me know, and I'll assist you further!

## Prompt 12 ##

It seems that the shelf_cors package is unusable anymore. Is there any other way to do it?

## Answer 12 ##

Absolutely! If `shelf_cors` is not usable anymore, we can manually add the CORS headers to the backend response.

Here's a simple modification to your `_router` function (or wherever you're processing requests) to include the necessary CORS headers:

```dart
shelf.Response _router(shelf.Request request) {
  switch (request.url.path) {
    case 'users':
      return _addCorsHeaders(_usersHandler(request));
    default:
      return shelf.Response.notFound('Not Found');
  }
}

// Add this function to manually insert the CORS headers
shelf.Response _addCorsHeaders(shelf.Response response) {
  return response.change(headers: {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Origin, Content-Type',
  });
}

The `_addCorsHeaders` function can be applied to any response that should support CORS. In the example above, it's added to the `/users` endpoint.

With this modification, you've manually added the CORS headers to the backend response, which should resolve the CORS issue you were facing with the frontend.

Remember: The configuration provided (`'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'`) allows any origin to access the resources. In a production environment, you'd want to be more restrictive and specify only the trusted domains.
